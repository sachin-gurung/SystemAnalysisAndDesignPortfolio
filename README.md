#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass project was focused on designing a system that would help streamline the process of preparing for driver license test and schedule the tests online. The client wanted a user-friendly system to help users schedule tests, access study materials and manage appointments efficiently. 
  
#### What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well on identifying the system requirements and organizing it. I was also able to use Lucid chart to create diagrams that would help communicate with the stakeholders. The diagrams helped ensure consistency between the user interface and how the system behaved. 
  
#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If there was one part to revise, I'd pick the Gantt chart. My Gantt chart in the Business Requirements Document looks good but it's hard to read what's written in there. I would love to figure out a way to make it more readable. 

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting the user's needs was one of the most important steps in my system design process. Without knowing what the user wants, I cannot relay the message to the development team what the system is supposed to do or look like. I focused on the key functionalities that the system is supposed to have such as appointment management, user accounts, different user access etc. It is very important to consider the user's needs when designing because they will be the ones using the system and if its not user-friendly to them and doens't do what they need the system to do, it will simply be a waste of everyone's time and effort. 

#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I'd approach designing software by gathering requirements and understand what the user really wants us to design. I'd use UML diagrams to maintain clarity during communication. I'd also user testing and feedback loops to refine the design.
